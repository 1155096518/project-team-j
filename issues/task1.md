Please set up the file **`readme.md`** with the following contents, which will be displayed automatically when entering this repo, and also in the github.io page.

You have to finish these:
1. Set up 3 headings: **Introduction**, **Code**, and **Contributors**
2. Under **Introduction**, write a short summary of things your team will do according to the tasks under "Issues"
3. Ensure your article is well-formatted with Markdown
4. There is no point 4!
