# #2: Include data into readme

Please read about **`include_relative`** on this page: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/

Here are your tasks:
1. Edit **`readme.md`**
2. Under **Contributors**, use **`include_relative`** to include your own md file under the folder `_stu`
3. At the bottom of the page, include the last updated time using `site.time` (HOW?)

(Feel free to enhance the page outlook by changing the theme, or preparing new CSS!)
