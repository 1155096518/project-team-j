# #3: Project board

Please explore the **Projects** tab

Your tasks:
1. Create a new project board (with any name), and use the **Basic Kanban** template, containing *"To do"*, *"In Progress"*, and *"Done"*
2. Set up these automation:
- When pull requests are added, put the item in "In progress"
- When issues are closed, put the item in "Done"
- When pull requests are merged, put the item in "Done"
3. Regularly visit the **Issues** and **Pull requests** tabs to make sure items are marked with your project board
