# #4: Write C code

Please start to remember what you have done for C class. Or learn it anew.

Your tasks:
1. In **`code.c`**, write a piece of very simple (yet correct) C code (e.g. Hello World, simple for loop, simple if...then...else, etc.)
2. In **`readme.md`**, include your code (either copy & paste or `include_relative`)
3. Read this article to see how to get the GitHub shield for Travis CI, and put it inside **`readme.md`** with your code: https://hackernoon.com/continuous-integration-using-travis-on-github-1f7f2314b6b7

(Note: Travis CI is already installed on this repo)
