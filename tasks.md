# CSCI3250+3251 Project Milestone #3

Welcome! You are now assigned into a team with a number of your classmates, randomly. You are not sure who are in this group, and when they would start working.

## Tools to use
You are allowed to use any software (git commands, GitHub web, Atom, etc.) to interact with the system

## Your tasks
0. Feel free to discuss in the team discussion board
1. In the folder **`_stu`**, create a file named `1155xxxxxx.md` (with your own SID), having the contents only as your full name, with your GitHub username
2. Under the **Projects** tab in the **Work!** board, create a new card under **To do** and introduce yourself
3. There may be issues in **Issues**, so please do it in the order #1 -> #2 -> #3 -> #4 -> #5 (although it may still work if not obeyed)
4. If you want to work on that issue, assign yourself to the issue (and others SHOULD NOT double assign!!)
5. After you are done, pick any reviewer that's available (but not @chuckjee or @wbwuta)
6. Be an effective and efficient reviewer
7. Put down proper comments in every request
8. When Issue #2 is done, please check the **`readme.md`** file and add your own line in **Contributors**
9. When you consider all your work is done, please go to the **Projects** board and more your intro to **Done**

## Reviewing
- There may be a lot of review requests of issues and pull requests (when people are adding files). Please carefully check the relevant tasks if they are done well, and choose to **Comment** or **Approve**.
- After reviewing that an issue is done correctly, you can close it (with comments)
- After reviewing that a pull request is okay to merge, merge it and close the request (with comments)

## Workload constraints
- Every student should be assigned to **no more than ONE** issue
- Every student should make **no more than TWO** reviews

## Submission deadline
Everything will be finalised by April 23 23:59
